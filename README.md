# Knapsack Problem ðŸŽ’

The Knapsack Problem is a classic combinatorial optimization problem.
It models a situation where you must choose a subset of items to maximize the total value without exceeding a weight limit.

This project focuses on solving the classic **Knapsack Problem** using various metaheuristic and custom approaches.  
It serves both as a learning exercise in optimization algorithms and as a practical comparison of different solution strategies.

## âœ¨ Implemented Methods:

- **Custom Algorithm**  
  A handcrafted algorithm based on greedy strategies.
  
- **Random Solution**  
  Generates random feasible solutions to serve as a baseline for comparison.
  
- **Hill Climbing**  
  Starts from an initial solution and iteratively makes small improvements to reach a local optimum.
  

## ðŸ§  Project Focus

- Experiment with different metaheuristic optimization techniques
- Understand trade-offs between exploration and exploitation
- Analyze performance and solution quality across multiple approaches
